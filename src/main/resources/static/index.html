					<h3>Welcome to my soon to be dev blog. </h3>
					<p>
						I know there are simpler and easier
						way to have one than building it yourself but I wanted to learn more
						about front end development as well as the corresponding back end and
						find out as much as need for self hosting.<br>
						As you can imagin I like DIY solutions for challenges where I can
						expand or enchance my knowledge and I see setting up a web application
						all by myself like that.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am a Java developer since the summer of 2013 and was mainly involved
						with server side programming but occasionally got involved with some
						thick/thin client development and was helping out with operations tasks
						time to time there is still much to learn and I amy happy to do it.
					</p>
					<p>
						That is all I have time to say for now in this short post. See you
						next time.
